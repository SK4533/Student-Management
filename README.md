The Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++.
It allows users to add, display, modify, and delete student records.
The system uses classes and file handling to manage data efficiently.
A menu-driven interface makes navigation simple and user-friendly.
It's a great project to practice object-oriented programming and data management in C++.
